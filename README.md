# line-grapher
Line graphing tool made with Python and the turtle module.

Currently, this program graphs lines given slopes and y-intercepts. In the future, I plan to add the ability
to graph more types of functions (quadratic, cubic, exponential, logistic, etc.) and GUI functionality. 

The only system requirement is to have Python3 installed, which can be done [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once downloaded, run `main.py`.

From there, enter the color you want the line to be, the slope, and the y-intercept.

__You can even graph multiple lines!__
