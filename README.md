# line-grapher
Line graphing tool made with Python and the turtle module.

Currently, this program graphs lines given slopes and y-intercepts. In the future, I plan to add the ability
to graph more types of functions (quadratic, cubic, exponential, logistic, etc.). 

The only system requirement is to have Python3 installed, which can be done [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once downloaded, run main.py.
